# React Drum Machine
## Project for the Frontend libraries certification of FreeCodeCamp -> https://www.freecodecamp.org/portuguese/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine
### To complete the project you must build your own drum using some of the libraries teached on the course, like Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux or JQuery, use the CDN link to implement tests, test it, and pass the 8 tests that are based on the user stories.

#### * You can see the user stories that are tested on the live page of the project on the tests menu or on the link above.

I built the project using **React** and the `useState()` hook to display the sound lively. Also used the Vite tool to help and improve the development. The project is very straightforward, it have a `ButtonsPad` component wich renders the buttons of the drum, some functions to handle `onClick()` and `handleKey()` to play the sound and a range input to set the volume of the sound playing. The styling was made using pure CSS with the help of some online tools like [MagicPattern](https://www.magicpattern.design/tools/css-backgrounds) and Box Shadow generator. Also some JS function to animate the buttons on click.

This was a fun project to make, learn a lot about the `useState()` hook to functional components cause i leraned React the old school way, with class components. I also worked a lot with DOM manipulation and console debugging. With this project i started to think in a React way, more than in a JS vanilla way.
